      <li>cook : 30 mins</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Sift the flours into a bowl or wide jug and tip any bits in the sieve back into the bowl. Add the egg yolks and a splash of milk then stir to a thick paste. Add the remaining milk a little at a time so you don’t make lumps in the batter.</li>
      <li>Whisk the egg whites until they stand up in stiff peaks, then fold them carefully into the batter – try not to squash out all the air.</li>
      <li>Heat a non-stick pan over a medium heat and pour in enough batter to make a pancake about 10 cm across. Cook for just under a minute until bubbles begin to pop on the surface and the edges are looking a little dry. Carefully turn the pancake over. If it is a bit wet on top, it may squirt out a little batter as you do so. In that case, leave it on the other side a little longer. Keep warm while you make the remaining pancakes. Serve with your favourite healthy toppings.</li>
